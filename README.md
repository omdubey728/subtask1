# About me
A stoic ambivert who loves listening to music, watching anime, playing video games, and eating good food. I was born and raised in Amdavad, Gujarat with roots belonging to Gorakhpur, UP, and as a result am a litti chokha eating garba-raas lover. I entered IIT Guwahati with a dream of pursuing a research career in Astrophysics. My natural enjoyment while coding and curiosity to explore every field has now led me to this very moment!
